    <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>  
    <p>As the greatest mathematician of the 18th century, Leonhard Euler was born in Basel, Switzerland, where he studied under the prominent mathematician Jean Bernoulli. In 1731, he took on the role of professor of physics and mathematics at the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Renowned for his prolific output, Euler published over 800 books and papers throughout his career, impacting fields such as physics and astronomy. His seminal work, <em>Introductio in analysin infinitorum</em> (1748), remained a key textbook for over a hundred years. He also composed <em>Lettres à une princesse d'Allemagne</em> (1768-1772), providing a non-technical overview of major physical theories for the Princess of Anhalt-Dessau.</p>  
    <p>It's nearly impossible to engage in mathematics without referencing Euler's contributions. Notations that are still prevalent today, including <var>e</var> and <var>π</var>, originated in his work. Euler is perhaps most celebrated for his exploration of mathematical analysis, notably through his famous formula:</p>  
    <p>cos(x) + i sin(x) = e<sup>(ix)</sup></p>  
    
    <p>This equation elegantly demonstrates the connection between algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry. From it, one can derive the remarkable formula:</p>  
    <p>e<sup>(πi) + 1 = 0</sup></p>  
    
    <p>This expression beautifully unites fundamental constants: 0, 1, <var>π</var>, <var>e</var>, and <var>i</var>, into a single, remarkable statement.</p>  
    
    <p>Leonhard Euler passed away in 1783, leaving a legacy in mathematics that is truly exceptional and unparalleled in its impact.</p>
